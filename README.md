## 1. Overview

TaskBeam is a platform that integrates Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers directly into the apps people already use every day such as Gmail, Twitter/X, Instagram, Farcaster, Slack, Notion, etc.
Our mission is to eliminate installation friction and enable users to run MCP-powered actions without needing and standalone clients.
**Think of it as “Zapier for MCP”, a universal bridge between MCP servers and mainstream applications.**

## 2. The Problem

- Currently, MCP Servers face three major adoption barriers:
- **Platform Lock-in:** Users can only access MCP through limited clients (e.g., Claude Desktop).
- **High Friction Onboarding:** Installing extra software is a major barrier for casual and enterprise users.
- **No Presence where Users already Work:** MCP is not embedded inside everyday productivity, communication, and social platforms.

These limitations restrict MCP to early adopters and technical users, leaving mainstream adoption untapped.

## 3. The Solution

TaskBeam creates a cloud-based interface layer that:

- Connects MCP servers to popular applications via APIs and OAuth integrations.
- Lets users trigger and execute MCP actions natively inside Gmail, Twitter, Instagram and other popular applications.
- Remove the needs for installing standalone MCP clients.
- Supports cross-application automation (e.g., “Summarize my unread Gmail and post updates to my team Slack.”).

This approach:

- Expands the MCP ecosystem beyond the niche.
- Enables mainstream consumer and enterprise adoption.
- Positions MCP as an invisible but essential background capability.
